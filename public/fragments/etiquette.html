  <p>Sri Guru Singh Sabha Gurdwara in Derby started around ten years ago it used to be sited not far from here but moved to this current building relatively recently. Since moving, the Gurdwara has grown in leaps and bounds spearheading the move towards building a Sikh Faith School and housing the National Sikh Heritage Museum and Holocaust Centre, which receives thousands of visitors a year.</p>
  <p>Coupled with its rich source of scholarly religous representatives and drive to prepare the next generation for the future, Sri Guru Singh Sabha Gurdwara aims to ensure a healthy community is built, one that understands their history and culture but also can integrate well with the wider community.</p>
